# Cancer-Prediction


The project aims to predict various type of cancer by analyzing image of area of skin which is affected by cancer. It takes a 
picture of affected area and categories in the different type of cancers.

Dataset : 
This project uses MNIST : HAM10000 dataset. Which contains 10000 images of skin cancer.
The final dataset consists of 10015 dermatoscopic images which can serve as a training set for academic machine learning purposes. Cases include a representative collection of all important diagnostic categories in the realm of pigmented lesions.

The dataset consist of 10000 images. Which are converted and stored in numerical form(in the form of pixel values) in a CSV file. 
Each image is narrowed down to a 28X28 image. The pixel value for each pixel is stored in columns and rows consist all the pictures.
There are 10000 rows and 784 columns. Each row represents a 28X28 image.

#### GUI :
Simple GUI is designed using Python's Tkinter library. You can find the file Gui.py.
